I'm a mechanical engineering master's student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/), Switzerland.
Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), China.


My interest in robot perception and computer vision was sparked by the 2021 [ETH Robotics Summer School](https://robotics-summerschool.ethz.ch/) and numerous courses, and it was later bolstered by projects with [Robotic Systems Lab (RSL)](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) and [Computer Vision and Geometry Group (CVG)](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) on volumetric mapping, offline Python SLAM, and 3D line reconstruction.


My current research interest focuses on incorporating deep learning approaches into SLAM and 3D reconstruction.
